# [LIGHT AS PARTICLES, COLOR AS VIBRATION]

# Impressionist/Pointillist Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces channeling Impressionist light and Pointillist color theory—optical color mixing, visible brushwork/dots, capturing light over form, atmosphere over precision, and colors that vibrate when adjacent
* **Constraint Parameters**: Color mixing happens in the eye (not blended digitally); visible "stroke" or particle structure; soft edges, no hard outlines; complementary colors adjacent for vibration; time-of-day light awareness; atmosphere over accuracy; scientific color theory applied aesthetically
* **Reference Context**: Georges Seurat (pointillism, divisionism, chromoluminarism), Claude Monet (light studies, haystacks, water lilies), Camille Pissarro (later pointillist work), Paul Signac (color theory), contemporary: digital pointillism, particle systems
* **Edge Case Handling**: For readability, solid color zones for text; for accessibility, ensure optical mixing doesn't fail for color blindness; for performance, balance particle density with rendering; for dark mode, shift to evening/indoor Impressionist palette
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Optical mixing success, light quality, particle visibility, color vibration, atmospheric depth

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary particles: Cobalt blue (#0047AB), Cadmium yellow (#FFF600), Vermillion (#E34234), Viridian (#40826D)
  - Complementary pairs: Orange/Blue, Yellow/Violet, Red/Green (adjacent for vibration)
  - Light palette: Morning (cool blues, pink), Midday (warm yellows, white), Evening (orange, violet)
  - Background: Cream canvas (#FDF5E6), or sky gradients built from particles
  - No black (mix complementaries for darks); no hard outlines
  - Particle sizes: 2-6px base, scaling with element importance

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Canvas API for particle rendering at scale
  - SVG circles for simpler pointillist elements
  - CSS `radial-gradient` patterns for quick approximation
  - Dithering algorithms for image-to-pointillist conversion
  - `mix-blend-mode` for color interaction enhancement
  - Viewport-aware particle density (fewer on mobile)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA for text on solid zones (not over particle fields)
  - Test color pairs for color blindness (some complementaries fail)
  - Particle layer marked decorative; content independent
  - Reduce particle motion for vestibular sensitivity
  - Provide "solid color" mode extracting dominant hues

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Canvas for complex particle systems and image conversion
  - SVG for simple decorative pointillist elements
  - CSS patterns for backgrounds and accents
  - WebGL for large-scale atmospheric effects
  - Pre-rendered particle images for performance-critical areas

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If solid color needed → Build from adjacent particle colors that optically mix
  - If shadow needed → Use complementary color particles, not black
  - If image present → Convert to pointillist; or frame with particle border
  - If background → Particle field suggesting atmosphere/light
  - If text → Solid zone; particles can surround but not underlay
  - If interactive → Particles can respond (ripple, scatter, attract)

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Optical mixing (colors blend in eye, not on screen)
  2. Light quality (design should feel illuminated)
  3. Particle visibility (stroke/dot structure apparent)
  4. Atmospheric depth (air, light, time-of-day feeling)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Impressionist color palette in solid blocks
  - Basic: Simple CSS-based dot patterns, gradient approximations
  - Full: Dynamic particle systems, interactive light response, image pointillism

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Canvas particles fall back to pre-rendered images
  - Dynamic systems fall back to static particle fields
  - Complex mixing falls back to optical mix target colors (pre-mixed)
  - Print: Actual halftone dots achieve similar effect

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Particle density obscures content; optical mixing muddy
* 3: Functional but some particle areas unclear
* 5: Particles enhance atmosphere without impeding; text areas clean; light guides the eye

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Color pairs fail for color blindness; particles over text; no alternatives
* 3: Text readable; particle layer separated; basic fallbacks
* 5: Full compliance; color pairs tested for all vision types; solid mode available; AT clean

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Particle systems tank performance; too many DOM/Canvas elements
* 3: Runs on modern devices; mobile needs optimization
* 5: Efficient particle rendering; LOD based on device; smooth 60fps

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Particle size fixed; density wrong at different viewports
* 3: Adapts but loses optical mixing at some scales
* 5: Particle size and density scale intelligently; optical mixing works at all sizes

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Random dots without color theory; no light logic
* 3: Recognizable pointillism but color mixing inconsistent
* 5: Scientific color theory applied; consistent light source; genuine optical vibration achieved

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Adjacent complementary colors present in at least one element (orange/blue, etc.)
  - No pure black (#000000) in particle system (darks mixed from complementaries)
  - Particle structure visible at 100% zoom (not blurred into solid)
  - Text achieves WCAG AA on solid zones, not over particle fields
  - Squinting at screen should blend particles into intended mixed color

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify optical mixing: ask users what color they perceive (should match intent)
  - Test light perception: should feel "luminous," "airy," "atmospheric"
  - Evaluate particle visibility: should feel painterly, not pixelated
  - Color blindness testing: ensure pairs don't disappear

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Optical mixing produces mud instead of vibrant mixed color
  - Particles feel like noise rather than intentional strokes
  - Light quality absent (feels flat despite particles)
  - Color blindness simulation shows information loss
  - Performance issues from particle density

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Color theory reference (complementary pairs, optical mixing targets)
  - Particle generation parameters (size, density, distribution)
  - Light palette per time-of-day (morning, midday, evening, overcast)
  - Image conversion algorithm (photo to pointillist)
  - Accessibility color pair validation results
  - Artist reference mood board (Seurat, Signac, late Pissarro)
  - Fallback color values (pre-mixed for when particles can't render)

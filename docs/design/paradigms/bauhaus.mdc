# [FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION, PRIMARY GEOMETRY]

# Bauhaus Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements embodying functional modernism through primary colors, fundamental geometric shapes, asymmetric balance, and the unity of art and industrial design
* **Constraint Parameters**: Limit to primary colors (red, yellow, blue) plus black and white; shapes restricted to circle, triangle, square; no decorative elements without function; asymmetry must feel balanced
* **Reference Context**: Wassily Kandinsky's color theory, Herbert Bayer typography, Marcel Breuer furniture, Bauhaus Dessau building, László Moholy-Nagy photography, Josef Albers color studies
* **Edge Case Handling**: For extended palettes, derive from primaries (orange = red + yellow); for complex UI, use primaries for key actions only; for accessibility, ensure primaries meet contrast on white
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Geometric purity, functional justification, color harmony within constraints, compositional balance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary red: #E53935 (Kandinsky warm)
  - Primary yellow: #FDD835 (Kandinsky light)
  - Primary blue: #1E88E5 (Kandinsky cold)
  - Neutrals: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Grays derived from black transparency
  - Typography: Geometric sans only (Futura, ITC Bauhaus, DIN, Universal by Bayer reconstruction)
  - Shapes: Circle (movement, infinity), Triangle (aggression, direction), Square (stability, calm)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG for all geometric elements
  - CSS shapes for basic circle/square elements
  - Grid system based on geometric modules (square grid units)
  - No border-radius except 50% (full circle) or 0 (square)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance; primary blue on white = 3.1:1 (use for large text/graphics only)
  - Primary red on white = 4.0:1 (acceptable)
  - Black on yellow highest contrast for critical elements
  - Shapes must communicate alongside color (color-blind safe)

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Pure CSS for shapes where possible
  - SVG for complex compositions
  - No shadows (contradicts flat philosophy)
  - No gradients (maintain color purity)
  - No photography except as background material, desaturated

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If primary action → Red (attention, urgency)
  - If secondary action → Blue (trust, calm)
  - If warning/highlight → Yellow (with black text)
  - If static content → Black and white
  - If navigation element → Geometric shape indicator (circle bullet, triangle arrow, square stop)

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Functional clarity (every element must have a purpose)
  2. Geometric purity (shapes are fundamental, not decorative)
  3. Color intentionality (primaries reserved for meaning)
  4. Compositional balance (asymmetry that feels resolved)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Black and white with clear typography
  - Basic: Add primary color for key interactive elements
  - Full: Geometric compositions, shape-based iconography, modular grid

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Shapes fall back to CSS borders and backgrounds
  - Colors maintain meaning in grayscale (ensure value differentiation)
  - Print: Shapes outlined if color printing unavailable

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Geometric shapes used decoratively without functional purpose
* 3: Most elements functional but some shapes feel arbitrary
* 5: Every shape communicates; every color signals; form perfectly serves function

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Yellow text on white; meaning conveyed by color alone
* 3: Meets standards but some primary color combinations borderline
* 5: Full compliance; shapes reinforce color meaning; works completely in grayscale

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Complex SVG paths for simple shapes; unnecessary markup
* 3: Clean but some redundancy in shape definitions
* 5: CSS shapes where sufficient; single SVG symbol definitions; minimal code for maximum impact

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Geometric compositions break at different sizes; grid doesn't adapt
* 3: Scales but requires manual adjustment of compositions
* 5: Modular grid accommodates any content; shapes scale proportionally; compositions reflow naturally

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Shapes mixed without system; colors used arbitrarily; feels like clip art
* 3: Recognizably Bauhaus but some elements feel disconnected
* 5: Unified geometric language; color use follows strict logic; could be a Kandinsky composition

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Only circles, triangles, and squares present (no arbitrary curves or polygons)
  - Colors match exact primary definitions (no tints unless intentional transparency)
  - No decorative element lacks functional justification
  - Grid modules maintain consistent proportions across breakpoints

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users can identify interactive elements by color/shape alone
  - Test that geometric composition aids rather than confuses navigation
  - Evaluate perception: should feel "modern," "functional," "artistic"

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Any shape added without clear functional purpose
  - Color used for decoration rather than communication
  - Users confused by geometric navigation elements
  - Composition feels chaotic rather than dynamically balanced

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Shape-meaning mapping (which shape indicates what)
  - Color-function mapping (which color signals what action type)
  - Grid module specifications
  - Composition principles (asymmetric balance techniques)
  - Historical reference guide for team education

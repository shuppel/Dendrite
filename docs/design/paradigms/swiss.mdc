# [GRID PRECISION, TYPOGRAPHIC CLARITY]

# Swiss/International Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements embodying objective clarity through mathematical grid systems, sans-serif typography, asymmetric layouts, and purposeful white space
* **Constraint Parameters**: Strict grid adherence; typography as primary design element; minimal decoration; content hierarchy through scale and weight only; no ornamental graphics
* **Reference Context**: Josef Müller-Brockmann poster work, Neue Grafik journal, Helvetica documentary, Massimo Vignelli's NYC subway system, Dieter Rams' Braun design
* **Edge Case Handling**: For content-heavy layouts, increase grid columns; for mobile, reduce to 4-column grid with maintained proportions; for marketing, allow single accent color
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Grid alignment precision, typographic hierarchy clarity, information density optimization, visual noise reduction

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary palette: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), single accent color if needed (pure red #FF0000, blue #0000FF traditional)
  - Gray scale: #333333, #666666, #999999, #CCCCCC, #F5F5F5
  - Typography: Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Univers, Inter (web-safe alternative)
  - Grid: 12-column with consistent gutter (typically 20px); baseline grid for vertical rhythm
  - Spacing scale: 8px base unit (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS Grid for layout structure
  - Modular type scale (1.25 or 1.333 ratio)
  - Baseline grid alignment (line-height as common multiple)
  - Max content width: 1440px with fluid internal grid

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AAA target (7:1 contrast ratio)
  - Minimum body text 16px
  - Clear heading hierarchy (one H1, sequential levels)
  - Focus states via underline or outline, not color alone

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS Grid/Flexbox only; no float-based layouts
  - System font stack acceptable for performance
  - No icon fonts; SVG icons if required (geometric, single-weight)
  - Zero decorative images; photography only if content-relevant

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If text content → Left-align; ragged right edge; no justification
  - If heading → Bold weight; size increase minimum 1.5x from body
  - If image required → Full-bleed or exact grid-column fit; no arbitrary sizing
  - If call-to-action → Typographic emphasis only (weight/size) or minimal rectangular button
  - If data display → Table with strong grid lines; no zebra striping

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Information clarity (message comprehension is paramount)
  2. Grid integrity (every element aligns to grid intersections)
  3. Typographic quality (proper kerning, leading, measure)
  4. Visual simplicity (remove until it breaks)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Semantic HTML with browser defaults
  - Basic: Typography scale + basic grid alignment
  - Full: Precise baseline grid, optical adjustments, refined spacing

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - System sans-serif maintains style integrity
  - Grid degrades to single-column on narrow viewports
  - Print stylesheet: increase contrast, remove any background colors

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Grid so rigid content is truncated or awkwardly wrapped
* 3: Functional but some content fights against grid constraints
* 5: Grid liberates content; hierarchy instantly clear; navigation intuitive through typography alone

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Contrast issues; tiny text in pursuit of aesthetics; poor heading structure
* 3: Meets WCAG AA; some improvements possible in focus states
* 5: WCAG AAA; exemplary heading hierarchy; optimal reading measure (45-75 characters); clear landmarks

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Overly complex grid definitions; inconsistent spacing values
* 3: Clean implementation with minor redundancies
* 5: Minimal CSS; design tokens for all values; single source of truth for grid and type

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Fixed pixel grid breaks at edge cases; new content types don't fit
* 3: Handles most content but requires custom overrides for edge cases
* 5: Infinitely extensible grid; any content type fits naturally; spacing/type scale accommodates all needs

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Mixed alignments; inconsistent spacing; decorative elements crept in
* 3: Mostly consistent but occasional grid violations or weight inconsistencies
* 5: Mathematical precision throughout; every element justified by grid; typography sings

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All elements align to column grid (0px offset tolerance)
  - Type sizes match defined scale exactly (no arbitrary values)
  - Spacing values all divisible by base unit (8px)
  - Line lengths between 45-75 characters for body text

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Measure time to locate specific information (should outperform decorated alternatives)
  - Test content hierarchy comprehension without reading full text
  - Evaluate professional perception (should register as "authoritative," "trustworthy," "clear")

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Any element found not aligning to grid
  - User testing shows confusion about content hierarchy
  - Stakeholder additions of decorative elements (push back with rationale)
  - Line length exceeds 75 characters at any breakpoint

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Grid specification with column counts, gutters, margins per breakpoint
  - Type scale with exact sizes, weights, line-heights, use cases
  - Spacing scale reference
  - Alignment rules and exceptions (if any)
  - Photography guidelines (crop ratios, grid fit, content requirements)

# [BOLD GEOMETRY, PLAYFUL ABSTRACTION]

# Neo-Geo Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements channeling 1980s Neo-Geometric Conceptualism through bold primary shapes, saturated colors, playful compositions, and irreverent geometric arrangements
* **Constraint Parameters**: High saturation required; shapes as primary content not decoration; embrace visual tension and unexpected juxtapositions; balance playfulness with usability; more Memphis than Bauhaus
* **Reference Context**: Peter Halley neon paintings, Ashley Bickerton constructions, Memphis Milano, Sottsass interiors, early MTV graphics, Keith Haring geometry, Camille Walala murals
* **Edge Case Handling**: For professional contexts, reduce saturation 20% and increase whitespace; for dark mode, shapes become light on dark (retain saturation); for mobile, simplify to hero shapes, not pattern fields
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Visual energy, playful perception, geometric boldness, compositional tension resolution

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary saturated: Red #FF3B3B, Yellow #FFE135, Blue #3B5BFF, Green #35D073
  - Secondary saturated: Pink #FF6EC7, Orange #FF9F1C, Cyan #00E5FF, Purple #B84DFF
  - Neutrals: Black #0D0D0D, White #FFFFFF, occasional Gray #E0E0E0
  - Typography: Bold geometric sans (Futura Bold, Gilroy, Bebas Neue, Clash Display); display at extreme weights
  - Shapes: Circles, semicircles, triangles, squares, arcs, zigzags, squiggles, dots in grids

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG for complex geometric compositions
  - CSS shapes for basic elements
  - Hard edges (no shadows, no gradients—exception: intentional color-block gradients)
  - Generous shape scale (shapes should dominate, not decorate)
  - Overlap and intersection common

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; saturated colors require white or black text only
  - Shapes must not obscure content
  - Reduce visual complexity for motion-sensitive users
  - Text areas need solid backgrounds despite surrounding chaos

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - SVG and CSS shapes; no raster except photography (rare)
  - Animation: playful but not frenetic; shapes can move, rotate, scale
  - No subtle effects; everything confident and bold
  - JavaScript for interactive compositions; keep simple for static

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If hero section → Large geometric composition with 3+ overlapping shapes
  - If content area → Solid background (can be saturated), shapes as accents
  - If interactive element → Shape-based button (pill, circle, parallelogram)
  - If divider needed → Zigzag, dots, or bold stripe pattern
  - If whitespace available → Fill with secondary shapes at reduced opacity or outline

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Visual energy (design should feel alive and dynamic)
  2. Geometric confidence (shapes are bold, never timid)
  3. Playful irreverence (break rules intentionally)
  4. Functional clarity (chaos is composed, not confusing)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Bold colors with geometric typography
  - Basic: Add simple shape accents and dividers
  - Full: Complex overlapping compositions, animated shapes, interactive geometry

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Reduce to single hero shape if performance constrained
  - Static SVG fallback for animated compositions
  - Colors remain saturated even in fallback (core to identity)
  - Print: Shapes become solid fills; overlap represented via halftone

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Shapes obscure navigation; visual chaos prevents task completion
* 3: Functional but shapes occasionally compete with content for attention
* 5: Geometry guides the eye; playfulness enhances engagement; clear despite complexity

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Saturated color combinations fail contrast; shapes overlay text
* 3: Core content accessible but some decorative elements problematic
* 5: Full compliance; text always on solid backgrounds; animation respects reduced-motion; color not sole differentiator

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Overly complex SVG paths; animation performance issues; bloated assets
* 3: Reasonable but some shapes could be simplified or combined
* 5: Optimized SVG symbols; efficient CSS shapes; smooth 60fps animation; minimal file size

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Compositions break at different viewports; shapes collide badly
* 3: Scales with manual adjustment; some breakpoints need custom compositions
* 5: Compositions designed fluid; shapes reposition elegantly; energy maintained at all sizes

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Random shapes and colors; feels like clip art explosion
* 3: Recognizable style but some elements feel out of place
* 5: Unified controlled chaos; color relationships harmonious; composition feels intentional despite irreverence

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Minimum 3 distinct shape types in any composition
  - Color saturation ≥ 80% for primary shapes
  - No shape smaller than 24px in any dimension
  - Text never directly overlays a shape boundary or intersection
  - At least one shape overlaps or intersects another per major section

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify emotional response includes "fun," "bold," "energetic"
  - Test that playfulness doesn't confuse navigation
  - Evaluate age perception: should feel contemporary, not dated-80s-kitsch

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users describe as "chaotic" or "overwhelming" (too far)
  - Users describe as "corporate" or "safe" (not far enough)
  - Shapes feel decorative rather than integral
  - Color combinations cause eye strain or vibration
  - Animation causes motion sickness reports

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Shape library with SVG primitives
  - Color combination rules (which pairs work, which vibrate)
  - Composition templates (hero, content, divider patterns)
  - Animation principles (timing, easing, interaction triggers)
  - Photography integration guidelines (rare; how to balance with geometry)
  - Don'ts gallery (common mistakes: too subtle, wrong era references, clip-art feel)

# [TWO-COLOR DRAMA, HIGH IMPACT]

# Duotone Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture
a
* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements using strict two-color treatment—applying dual-tone filters to imagery and limiting palette to two primary colors plus their blends for maximum visual impact and brand recognition
* **Constraint Parameters**: Exactly two colors per composition (plus their blend); apply to photography via gradient maps; UI elements derive from same two colors; high contrast required; monotone fallback acceptable
* **Reference Context**: Spotify marketing (green/purple, pink/orange), Pantone Color of the Year campaigns, Obama Hope poster, editorial magazine covers, Andy Warhol pop art
* **Edge Case Handling**: For photography, map shadows to dark color, highlights to light color; for dark mode, invert which color is shadow/highlight; for accessibility, ensure sufficient contrast between the two chosen colors
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Color impact, brand recognition, image treatment consistency, contrast effectiveness

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Color pairing strategies: Complementary (opposite wheel), Analogous (adjacent), High-contrast (dark + vibrant)
  - Popular pairings: Navy/Coral, Purple/Yellow, Teal/Magenta, Black/Gold, Deep Blue/Hot Pink
  - Shadow color: Darker, more saturated
  - Highlight color: Lighter, can be vibrant or neutral
  - Midtone: Natural blend of the two (not a third color)
  - Typography: Can be either color; prefer dark-on-light or light-on-dark zones

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS `filter: grayscale()` + gradient overlay for simple duotone
  - SVG filters with `feColorMatrix` for precise control
  - Canvas manipulation for real-time duotone
  - `mix-blend-mode: multiply` and `screen` for layered effects
  - Gradient maps in image processing (Photoshop/CSS filter chains)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; chosen colors must have 4.5:1 contrast for text
  - Don't rely on color alone—duotone images need context/labels
  - Test both colors as foreground/background combinations
  - Avoid color pairs that disappear for color blind users

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS filters for simple implementations
  - SVG filters for cross-browser precision
  - Pre-processed images for critical/hero content (performance)
  - Real-time filters for dynamic content only if performance allows

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If hero image → Full duotone treatment with brand colors
  - If thumbnail/gallery → Consistent duotone across all images
  - If UI element → Use one of the two colors as primary
  - If text → Place on solid color zone (not blended midtone)
  - If icon → Single color from the pair; avoid blends

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Brand recognition (color pair should be immediately identifiable)
  2. Image readability (subjects must remain recognizable through filter)
  3. Contrast effectiveness (colors must work together, not muddle)
  4. Consistency (every duotone treatment uses exact same colors)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Grayscale images with brand color tint
  - Basic: CSS filter duotone approximation
  - Full: Precise SVG filter duotone with optimized gradient mapping

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Duotone falls back to monotone (single brand color tint)
  - Filter-based falls back to pre-processed images
  - For email: Pre-processed duotone images required
  - For print: Convert to CMYK-safe equivalents

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Duotone obscures image content; subjects unrecognizable
* 3: Images readable but some details lost; UI occasionally confusing
* 5: Duotone enhances images; subjects clear; UI benefits from limited palette

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Color pair lacks contrast; text unreadable; color blind users see monotone
* 3: Meets WCAG AA; some edge cases with midtone zones
* 5: Full compliance; colors work for all vision types; high contrast maintained

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Heavy real-time filters on all images; performance issues
* 3: Reasonable approach but some optimization possible
* 5: Pre-processed hero images; efficient CSS filters for dynamic content; minimal runtime cost

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Inconsistent duotone application; some images different colors
* 3: Consistent but manual process for each image
* 5: Automated pipeline; design tokens for color pair; consistent across all imagery

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Colors clash; some images treated differently; brand unrecognizable
* 3: Mostly consistent but occasional color drift
* 5: Perfect color consistency; instantly recognizable; striking visual impact

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Exactly two colors in duotone formula (no additional tints introduced)
  - Contrast ratio between two colors ≥ 3:1 (for image legibility)
  - Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on solid color backgrounds
  - Same color values used across all duotone treatments
  - Filter renders consistently across target browsers

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify image subjects remain recognizable
  - Test brand recall: users should associate colors with brand
  - Evaluate emotional impact: should feel "bold," "striking," "cohesive"

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Image subjects become unrecognizable
  - Color pair fails contrast requirements
  - Inconsistency discovered across image treatments
  - Users cannot identify brand from color pair alone
  - Color blind simulation shows insufficient differentiation

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Exact color values for shadow/highlight
  - Filter implementation code (CSS, SVG, Canvas)
  - Image preparation guidelines (source image requirements)
  - Color pair contrast ratios documented
  - Usage rules (when to apply duotone vs. full color)
  - Fallback specifications

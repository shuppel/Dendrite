# [GEOMETRIC LUXURY, GILDED ELEGANCE]

# Art Deco Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements channeling 1920s-30s luxury through geometric symmetry, metallic accents, bold vertical lines, and ornamental precision
* **Constraint Parameters**: Strict bilateral symmetry preferred; geometric patterns over organic; metallic/jewel tones required; ornamentation must feel intentional not cluttered; balance opulence with usability
* **Reference Context**: Chrysler Building, Tamara de Lempicka paintings, Erte fashion illustrations, The Great Gatsby (2013) titles, Empire State Building lobby, vintage Pullman train interiors
* **Edge Case Handling**: For minimal contexts, reduce to geometric line work + single gold accent; for dark mode, use deep jewel backgrounds with gold/silver metallics; for mobile, simplify patterns to key structural elements
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Geometric precision, luxurious perception, symmetry execution, pattern density balance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary palette: Gold (#D4AF37, #FFD700), Black (#0A0A0A), Cream (#F5F0E6)
  - Jewel accents: Emerald (#046307), Sapphire (#0F52BA), Ruby (#9B111E), Amethyst (#9966CC)
  - Metallics: Gold gradient (45°, #BF953F → #FCF6BA → #B38728), Silver (#C0C0C0 → #E8E8E8 → #A8A8A8)
  - Typography: Geometric sans (Futura, Poiret One, Broadway) for display; high-contrast serif (Bodoni, Didot) for body
  - Line weights: Thin precise lines (1-2px) for patterns; bold strokes for structural elements

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG for geometric patterns (scalability critical)
  - CSS gradients for metallic effects
  - Border-image or SVG for ornamental frames
  - Clip-path for geometric masking

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; gold on black achieves this naturally
  - Patterns must not interfere with text readability
  - Reduce pattern complexity in high-information areas
  - Metallic effects need solid-color fallbacks for forced-colors mode

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - SVG patterns over raster images
  - CSS custom properties for metallic gradients (reusability)
  - No auto-generated patterns; each must be intentionally designed
  - Animation limited to subtle shimmer effects; no playful motion

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If header/hero → Full geometric frame treatment with metallic accents
  - If content area → Reduce ornamentation to corner accents or divider lines
  - If interactive element → Geometric button shape (hexagon, chevron, stepped rectangle)
  - If text heavy → Cream/white background, minimal pattern, strong typographic hierarchy
  - If dark background → Emphasize metallic gold; add subtle geometric line pattern

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Geometric integrity (patterns must be mathematically precise)
  2. Luxurious perception (every element should feel considered and expensive)
  3. Symmetry and balance (visual weight distributed intentionally)
  4. Usability (ornamentation supports rather than obscures function)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Black and gold color scheme with geometric typography
  - Basic: Add geometric dividers and simple framing
  - Full: Complex patterns, metallic gradients, ornamental corners, layered frames

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Metallic gradients fall back to solid gold (#D4AF37)
  - Complex SVG patterns fall back to solid backgrounds
  - Geometric frames fall back to simple borders
  - For print: Convert metallics to high-contrast solid tones

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Ornamentation obscures navigation; patterns compete with content
* 3: Functional but visual hierarchy occasionally unclear amid decoration
* 5: Ornamentation guides the eye; geometric structures reinforce information architecture

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Low contrast metallics; text over complex patterns; no high-contrast fallback
* 3: Core content accessible; decorative elements lack alternatives
* 5: Full WCAG compliance; forced-colors mode support; patterns never behind text; clear focus states

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Raster patterns causing bloat; repeated complex SVGs; gradient performance issues
* 3: Reasonable implementation with some optimization opportunities
* 5: Reusable SVG symbols; CSS custom properties for all metallics; patterns defined once, referenced many

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Patterns break at different sizes; ornamental frames don't adapt
* 3: Scales adequately but requires breakpoint-specific pattern adjustments
* 5: Vector patterns scale infinitely; frames adapt via CSS; ornamentation density responds to viewport

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Mixed geometric styles; inconsistent metallic tones; asymmetric where symmetry expected
* 3: Recognizably Art Deco but some elements feel disconnected from the era
* 5: Unified vision; consistent geometric vocabulary; metallics harmonize; feels like a coherent 1920s luxury piece

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All geometric patterns tile seamlessly (no visible seams at 400% zoom)
  - Symmetrical elements are pixel-perfect mirrors (0px deviation)
  - Metallic gradients have minimum 3 color stops for realistic sheen
  - Gold text on black maintains ≥ 4.5:1 contrast ratio

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify "luxury" and "elegance" appear in unprompted aesthetic descriptions
  - Test that ornamentation does not slow content location tasks
  - Evaluate era recognition (users should identify as "1920s," "Art Deco," "Gatsby")

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users describe design as "busy" or "cluttered"
  - Geometric patterns show visible imprecision
  - Metallic effects appear flat or muddy
  - Era associations skew wrong (Victorian, Baroque = too ornate; Minimalist = too stripped)

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Geometric pattern library (SVG files with usage guidelines)
  - Metallic gradient definitions (CSS custom properties)
  - Ornamental frame system with size/context variants
  - Typography pairing rules (display + body combinations)
  - Symmetry axis specifications for layout templates

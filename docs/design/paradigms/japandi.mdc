# [WABI-SABI MEETS HYGGE, IMPERFECT HARMONY]

# Japandi Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements fusing Japanese wabi-sabi philosophy with Scandinavian functional warmth—embracing imperfection, natural materials, intentional asymmetry, and serene simplicity
* **Constraint Parameters**: Earthy muted palette; subtle organic imperfections over machine precision; negative space as meditation; craft aesthetic; balance between warm (Scandi) and cool (Japanese) minimalism
* **Reference Context**: Axel Vervoordt interiors, Kengo Kuma architecture, Karimoku furniture, Studio Mumbai, Kinfolk/Cereal editorial overlap, Japanese tea ceremony aesthetics, Danish craft tradition
* **Edge Case Handling**: For digital precision contexts, add subtle texture overlays; for dark mode, use charcoal-brown not blue-black; for mobile, maintain contemplative spacing despite constraints
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Serenity perception, material authenticity, balance of cultures, imperfection intentionality

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Background: #FAF9F6 (warm white), #F5F3EE (paper), #EAE6DF (aged linen)
  - Earth neutrals: #D4CEC5, #B5AFA4, #8C857A, #5C564E
  - Accent (natural): Charcoal #3D3D3D, Terracotta #B8826A, Sage #8A9A7E, Indigo #4A5568, Ochre #C4A35A
  - Typography: Humanist sans (mix of Japanese simplicity and Nordic warmth): Inter, Noto Sans, Sora; optional: subtle serif for contrast (Cormorant, Noto Serif JP)
  - Roundness: Organic, imperfect curves (3-6px); corners can vary slightly element-to-element

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Generous whitespace (ma - negative space as design element)
  - Subtle paper/linen textures via CSS noise or SVG filters (optional, never heavy)
  - Low-contrast shadows: 0 4px 16px rgba(60,50,40,0.06)
  - Line heights: 1.7-2.0 (meditative reading pace)
  - Asymmetric grid allowed (break from strict columns)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance; earthy palette requires careful contrast checking
  - Warm darks on warm lights maintain readability
  - Sufficient size for touch targets despite minimal aesthetic
  - Text-based information over icon-only

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS with subtle filter/texture enhancements
  - SVG for hand-drawn style illustrations
  - Avoid machine-perfect geometry; introduce subtle variation
  - No glossy effects, harsh shadows, or digital "sheen"

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If container → Warm off-white, soft shadow, asymmetric padding acceptable
  - If line/divider → Thin, imperfect (hand-drawn SVG or dashed), not solid black
  - If interactive → Subtle state change; underline or gentle lift; no harsh color flip
  - If imagery → Desaturated, textured, natural subjects, imperfect framing welcome
  - If typography → Mixed weights for contrast; serif/sans pairing acceptable

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Serenity (design should induce calm, not stimulation)
  2. Material honesty (digital elements should reference natural textures)
  3. Intentional imperfection (wabi-sabi; perfection is sterile)
  4. Cultural balance (neither purely Japanese nor purely Nordic)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Warm neutrals, generous spacing, clean typography
  - Basic: Subtle textures, organic illustrations, asymmetric layouts
  - Full: Hand-drawn elements, material textures, contemplative animations (slow, gentle)

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Textures fall back to solid warm colors
  - Hand-drawn elements fall back to simple geometric shapes
  - Animations reduce to instant transitions for reduced-motion
  - Print: Emphasize typography and whitespace; textures optional

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Serenity prioritized over usability; users lost in whitespace
* 3: Functional but some interactions too subtle to discover
* 5: Calm guides function; users navigate intuitively; simplicity serves purpose

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Earthy palette creates contrast failures; imperfection harms readability
* 3: Meets WCAG AA; some edge cases need attention
* 5: Full compliance; imperfection never compromises legibility; generous sizing

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Heavy texture images; complex SVG filters impacting performance
* 3: Reasonable implementation; textures could be optimized
* 5: CSS-first textures; optimized SVG; minimal overhead for craft aesthetic

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Asymmetric layouts break responsively; textures don't tile
* 3: Scales with some manual intervention for complex layouts
* 5: Fluid asymmetry; textures scale or simplify gracefully; serenity maintained at all sizes

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Feels confused—neither Japanese nor Scandinavian; imperfection feels like error
* 3: Recognizable fusion but balance tips too far one direction
* 5: Perfect cultural synthesis; imperfections feel intentional; you want to touch the screen

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Color palette contains no pure black or pure white
  - At least one element per major section has organic/imperfect quality
  - Shadow colors are warm (brown/amber undertone), not cool (blue/gray)
  - Minimum whitespace between major elements is 32px
  - Typography line-height ≥ 1.6

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify emotional response includes "peaceful," "calming," "natural"
  - Test recognition of both Japanese and Scandinavian influences
  - Evaluate material perception: should feel "crafted," "tactile," not "digital"

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Design feels "too perfect" or "machine-made"
  - Cultural balance tips (>60% one direction)
  - Users describe as "cold" or "sterile"
  - Imperfections read as bugs not features
  - Stakeholders request "more polish" (educate on wabi-sabi)

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Color palette with undertone descriptions
  - Texture library (CSS and SVG options)
  - Imperfection guidelines (what varies, what stays consistent)
  - Spacing philosophy (ma concept explanation)
  - Cultural reference guide (tea ceremony, hygge, craft traditions)
  - Illustration style guide (hand-drawn, organic, natural subjects)

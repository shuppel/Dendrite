# [EARTH TONES, NATURAL FORMS]

# Organic/Nature Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements inspired by natural environments—earth tones, organic textures, botanical motifs, and the asymmetric beauty found in nature
* **Constraint Parameters**: Colors derived from natural sources; no harsh geometric precision; textures referencing natural materials (wood grain, stone, leaf veins); photography of nature as primary imagery
* **Reference Context**: Patagonia brand, national park signage, botanical gardens, eco-luxury resorts, Kinfolk magazine nature issues, Cereal travel editorial
* **Edge Case Handling**: For tech contexts, balance organic with necessary UI precision; for dark mode, use deep forest/night sky palettes; for accessibility, ensure earth tones maintain sufficient contrast
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Natural authenticity, environmental harmony, texture richness, calming emotional response

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Earth palette: Forest green (#2D5A3D), Terracotta (#C4745A), Sand (#D4C4A8), Stone gray (#8B8680), Bark brown (#5D4E37)
  - Sky/water accents: Soft blue (#7BA3B4), Sunset coral (#E8A87C), Dawn pink (#D4A5A5)
  - Backgrounds: Cream (#FAF6F0), Warm white (#FFFEF9), Soft sage (#E8EDE5)
  - Typography: Humanist serif (EB Garamond, Freight Text) for body; organic sans (Avenir, Proxima Nova) for UI
  - Textures: Paper grain, linen weave, subtle wood grain, watercolor washes

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG for botanical illustrations and organic shapes
  - CSS noise/grain filters for natural texture
  - Subtle parallax for depth (like forest layers)
  - Natural photography with consistent color grading (warm, desaturated)
  - Organic border-radius (varies per element, never uniform)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; earth tones require careful contrast pairing
  - Greens and browns can be problematic for color blindness—pair with texture
  - Nature photography needs meaningful alt text
  - Avoid relying on color alone for information

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS for textures and filters where possible
  - SVG for illustrations and decorative elements
  - Optimized photography (WebP, responsive images)
  - Avoid heavy parallax on mobile

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If hero section → Full-bleed nature photography with text overlay on solid zone
  - If container → Subtle paper/linen texture, organic shadow, asymmetric corners acceptable
  - If interactive element → Earth tone with natural hover (deepening like wet stone)
  - If divider → Organic line (hand-drawn SVG) or botanical element
  - If icon → Line illustrations with organic stroke variation

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Natural authenticity (nothing should feel synthetic or forced)
  2. Environmental harmony (elements relate like ecosystem)
  3. Texture richness (surfaces have tactile quality)
  4. Calm functionality (nature should soothe, not overwhelm)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Earth tone palette with clean typography
  - Basic: Add subtle textures, organic illustrations
  - Full: Parallax layers, animated botanical elements, rich photography

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Textures fall back to solid earth tones
  - Parallax falls back to static layered images
  - SVG illustrations fall back to raster with srcset
  - Print: Textures reproduce well; maintain warm color space

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Organic shapes obscure usability; nature imagery distracts from content
* 3: Functional but organic elements occasionally conflict with UI needs
* 5: Nature enhances without impeding; organic forms guide natural reading flow

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Earth tones create contrast failures; nature imagery lacks alt text
* 3: Meets WCAG AA; some color combinations need attention
* 5: Full compliance; texture reinforces (not replaces) color; rich alt text for imagery

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Massive unoptimized photography; complex SVG illustrations
* 3: Reasonable but image optimization could improve
* 5: Optimized images; efficient SVG; CSS textures over images; fast load times

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Organic shapes break at breakpoints; textures tile badly
* 3: Scales with some manual adjustment of photography crops
* 5: Responsive images; organic shapes adapt fluidly; textures scale or simplify gracefully

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Mixed natural references (tropical + alpine); synthetic elements creep in
* 3: Recognizable nature theme but some elements feel disconnected
* 5: Unified ecosystem; every element belongs to same natural environment; cohesive color grading

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Color palette derivable from single nature photograph
  - No pure geometric shapes (all have organic variation)
  - Photography color-graded to consistent warmth (within 500K color temperature)
  - Textures visible but not distracting (opacity 5-15%)
  - All nature photography has descriptive alt text

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify emotional response includes "calm," "natural," "grounded"
  - Test that organic elements don't confuse navigation
  - Evaluate authenticity: should feel "genuine" not "greenwashed"

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users describe as "corporate nature" or "stock photo feel"
  - Organic shapes create usability confusion
  - Color palette feels muddy or lacks energy
  - Textures cause performance issues or visual noise
  - Nature theme feels forced or inconsistent

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Color palette with natural source references
  - Texture library (CSS and image assets)
  - Photography guidelines (subject, color grading, cropping)
  - Illustration style guide (stroke variation, organic shapes)
  - Seasonal/regional variations if applicable
  - Sustainability of asset sourcing (stock vs. original)

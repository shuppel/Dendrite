# [DECONSTRUCT EVERYTHING, TRUST NOTHING]

# Post-Modern Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces that reject universal design truths—deconstructing UI conventions, mixing contradictory styles, embracing fragmentation, layering irony, and making the design process itself visible
* **Constraint Parameters**: No single consistent style; deliberately violate grid systems; mix high and low culture references; text can obscure, overlap, fragment; embrace contradiction and pastiche; self-reference and meta-commentary encouraged; question every "rule"
* **Reference Context**: David Carson's Ray Gun magazine, April Greiman's hybrid imagery, Emigre magazine, early Wired (1993-1998), Wolfgang Weingart typography, Cranbrook Academy, Tibor Kalman's Colors magazine, Stefan Sagmeister, Neville Brody
* **Edge Case Handling**: For usability, create deliberate tension between function and form (make users work, but reward them); for accessibility, provide stripped "sincere" mode; for brand safety, contain chaos within safe boundaries
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Rule violation count, style contradiction index, self-reference density, emotional provocation, functional friction (intentional)

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - There is no fixed palette (use whatever contradicts expectations)
  - Typography: Mix 3+ incompatible typefaces; overlay, fragment, rotate
  - Grid: Establish only to break; visible grid as design element
  - Imagery: Collage, appropriation, mixed resolution, visible artifacts
  - UI elements: Can be partially hidden, rotated, fragmented, or ironic
  - Voice: Self-aware, ironic, questions its own existence

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS transforms for rotation, skew, fragmentation
  - `mix-blend-mode` for aggressive layering
  - Variable fonts pushed to extremes
  - Intentional "broken" layouts (overflow visible, elements escaping containers)
  - Z-index chaos (elements interweaving unpredictably)
  - Print stylesheets that further deconstruct screen version

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG compliance is itself a construct to interrogate
  - However: Provide "accessible mode" toggle that delivers content sincerely
  - Core content must be accessible via screen reader even if visual is fragmented
  - Deliberate friction shouldn't exclude; it should reward persistence
  - Never use accessibility as excuse for actual exclusion

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS for most deconstruction (transforms, blend modes, clipping)
  - JavaScript for interactive questioning and self-modification
  - Consider content editable elements (user as co-author)
  - Version control visible to user (show edit history?)
  - The implementation itself can be visible (show-source aesthetic)

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If rule exists → Question why; break it or make breaking visible
  - If element "should" align → Consider deliberate misalignment
  - If style is consistent → Introduce contradiction
  - If user expects X → Deliver X ironically, or deliver anti-X with explanation
  - If design feels finished → Add layer of self-doubt or meta-commentary
  - If content is serious → Container can be irreverent (or vice versa)

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Provocation (design should make you think about design)
  2. Contradiction (contain multitudes; refuse easy categorization)
  3. Content access (chaos frames content; doesn't destroy it)
  4. Functional baseline (beneath the deconstruction, things work)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Readable content in semantic HTML (the "sincere" layer)
  - Basic: Typographic disruption, grid violation, style mixing
  - Full: Self-referential interface, meta-commentary, user participation in deconstruction

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Browsers that can't handle complexity get "straight" content (which is itself a statement)
  - Print: Either maximum deconstruction or maximum sincerity (not middle ground)
  - Reader mode / accessibility mode: Clean content (acknowledge the "real" beneath the performance)

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Deconstruction destroys usability; content inaccessible
* 3: Friction is intentional but some users can't find content
* 5: Friction is art; content is accessible beneath/through deconstruction; reward for engagement

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Uses "post-modern" as excuse for exclusion
* 3: Provides accessible alternative but treats it as lesser
* 5: Accessible mode is equal citizen; visual deconstruction doesn't affect AT; meta-commentary on accessibility itself

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Chaos requires massive CSS/JS; performance suffers
* 3: Functional but bloated by contradiction-serving code
* 5: Efficient chaos; contradiction achieved through clever CSS; small footprint for large effect

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Deconstruction designed for one viewport; breaks elsewhere
* 3: Adapts but loses some contradictions at certain sizes
* 5: Each viewport gets its own set of rule violations; responsive deconstruction

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Random chaos without intellectual framework
* 3: Recognizable post-modern aesthetic but contradictions feel arbitrary
* 5: Coherent incoherence; every violation is considered; you understand why rules are being broken

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Minimum 3 distinct style languages present in single view
  - At least one grid violation per major section
  - Typography includes minimum 2 "incompatible" typefaces
  - Content accessible via screen reader regardless of visual fragmentation
  - User can find core content within 10 seconds despite visual complexity

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users understand this is intentional (not broken)
  - Test emotional response: should provoke thought, not just frustration
  - Evaluate content findability beneath deconstruction
  - Measure engagement: users should spend time exploring, not bouncing

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users think site is broken rather than intentionally deconstructed
  - Chaos provides no reward for engagement
  - Deconstruction becomes its own predictable style (becomes what it critiques)
  - Accessibility truly excluded (not just deferred)
  - Irony is mean-spirited rather than inviting

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Theoretical framework (which post-modern ideas are being explored)
  - Rule violation inventory (which conventions are broken and why)
  - Sincerity layer specification (what's beneath the performance)
  - Accessibility escape hatches
  - Self-reference map (where does design comment on itself)
  - Appropriation sources and transformations
  - The documentation itself should question documentation conventions

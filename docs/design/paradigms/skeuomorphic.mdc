# [REALISTIC TEXTURES, PHYSICAL MIMICRY]

# Skeuomorphic Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements that mimic real-world physical objects through realistic textures, materials, lighting, and dimensional depth to leverage users' existing mental models
* **Constraint Parameters**: Textures must reference recognizable materials (leather, metal, wood, paper, fabric); lighting must be consistent across interface; depth through realistic shadows not arbitrary elevation; avoid uncanny valley of almost-real
* **Reference Context**: iOS 1-6 design language, early Apple iBooks (wood shelves), original Podcast app (reel-to-reel), Propellerhead Reason, Native Instruments plugins, classic audio software UIs
* **Edge Case Handling**: For dark mode, adjust material lighting not just colors; for mobile, simplify textures to reduce asset weight; for accessibility, ensure textures don't compromise contrast
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Material recognition, tactile perception, lighting consistency, affordance clarity, nostalgia/familiarity balance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Material palette: Brushed metal (#C0C0C0 → #E8E8E8), Leather (brown #8B4513 → #A0522D), Wood (#DEB887 → #8B7355), Paper (#FFFEF0 → #F5F5DC), Glass (rgba overlays)
  - Highlight color: White at 20-40% opacity for top/left edges
  - Shadow color: Black at 15-30% opacity for bottom/right edges
  - Typography: System fonts or material-appropriate (typewriter for paper, engraved for metal)
  - Stitching: 2px dashed lines with thread colors matching material

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - High-resolution texture assets (2x minimum for retina)
  - CSS gradients for metallic sheen
  - Inner shadows for inset/pressed states
  - Multiple layered shadows for realistic depth
  - border-image for complex frames (leather edges, metal bezels)

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; text must contrast against textures
  - Provide solid color zones for text content
  - Interactive affordances must be obvious (buttons look pushable)
  - Don't rely on texture alone for state communication

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS for gradients, shadows, basic textures
  - SVG/PNG for complex material textures (use sparingly for performance)
  - Sprite sheets for repeating textures
  - Consider CSS paint worklets for procedural textures (progressive enhancement)

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If button → Raised with highlight on top edge, shadow on bottom; inset on press
  - If container → Material-appropriate bezel/frame (metal rim, leather border, paper edge)
  - If toggle/switch → Physical switch metaphor with realistic travel animation
  - If slider → Track with groove texture; thumb with grippable surface
  - If text input → Inset field with paper or frosted glass texture

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Affordance clarity (users must instantly know how to interact)
  2. Material consistency (one material per component type)
  3. Lighting coherence (single light source across entire interface)
  4. Performance (textures must not slow rendering)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Solid colors with strong shadows for depth
  - Basic: CSS gradients for metallic/material effects
  - Full: Texture images, complex shadows, material-specific details (stitching, grain, reflections)

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Texture images fall back to CSS gradients approximating material
  - Complex shadows reduce to single drop shadow
  - High-detail assets swap to simplified versions on low-bandwidth
  - For print: Convert to high-contrast outlines with solid fills

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Realistic details obscure controls; users unsure what's interactive
* 3: Functional but some metaphors confusing (what does this knob do?)
* 5: Physical metaphors accelerate understanding; affordances crystal clear; interactions feel natural

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Text on busy textures; low contrast; states unclear
* 3: Core content accessible but some textured areas problematic
* 5: Full WCAG compliance; text on solid zones; states communicated via shape/position not just texture; high contrast maintained

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Massive texture files; render-blocking assets; janky interactions
* 3: Reasonable performance but optimization opportunities exist
* 5: Optimized sprites; CSS-first where possible; lazy-loaded enhancements; smooth 60fps interactions

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Textures pixelate or tile badly; shadows don't scale proportionally
* 3: Works at common sizes but edge cases break the illusion
* 5: Multi-resolution assets; shadows scale with element size; materials hold up at any zoom level

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Mixed materials without logic; inconsistent light direction; some elements flat, others deep
* 3: Mostly consistent but occasional lighting or material mismatches
* 5: Unified material story; single light source respected everywhere; every element feels part of the same physical object

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All shadows cast in consistent direction (typically bottom-right from top-left light)
  - Highlight and shadow colors complement material base color
  - Texture resolution sufficient at 2x display (no visible pixelation)
  - Interactive elements have minimum 3 states: default, hover, pressed (all visually distinct)
  - No text placed directly on high-frequency texture patterns

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users identify interactive elements without instruction
  - Test material recognition ("what is this made of?")
  - Evaluate tactile desire: users should want to touch/interact
  - Measure task completion vs flat UI baseline (should be equal or faster due to affordances)

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users fail to identify clickable elements
  - Material metaphor confuses rather than clarifies (e.g., leather notebook for settings)
  - Lighting inconsistencies spotted across interface
  - Performance metrics show texture-related slowdown
  - Users describe as "dated" rather than "premium" or "tactile"

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Material library with texture assets and CSS approximations
  - Light source diagram (position, intensity, color temperature)
  - Shadow calculation guide (blur, spread, offset by elevation level)
  - Component anatomy sheets showing material application
  - State transition specifications (default → hover → pressed → disabled)
  - Performance budget per texture type
  - Metaphor mapping (which physical object = which UI function)

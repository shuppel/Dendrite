# [MOVEMENT MINIMIZED, TARGETS MAXIMIZED]

# Fitts' Law / Motor-Optimized Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces scientifically optimized for human motor control—minimizing movement distance, maximizing target size, exploiting screen edges, and designing for natural hand/cursor motion patterns
* **Constraint Parameters**: All layouts derived from motor efficiency mathematics; radial menus for equidistant access; edge targets for infinite depth; thumb zone optimization for mobile; asymmetric layouts based on handedness; speed over aesthetics when conflict arises
* **Reference Context**: Blender pie menus, gaming radial wheels (GTA, Mass Effect), macOS dock magnification, Windows corner hot zones, Android's floating action button, marking menus (Maya), Apple Watch crown interaction
* **Edge Case Handling**: For accessibility, maintain motor optimization while accommodating limited mobility; for left-handed users, mirror layouts; for touchscreens, account for finger occlusion; for stylus, allow smaller precision targets
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Time-to-target, error rate, gesture completion speed, Fitts' index of difficulty, thumb reachability percentage

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Touch targets: 48px minimum (mobile), 44px minimum (desktop)
  - Radial menu radius: 80-120px optimal (full thumb arc without wrist movement)
  - Pie segments: 8 maximum per radial (45° minimum arc per target)
  - Screen edges: Primary actions within 50px of any edge
  - Corners: Reserved for most frequent actions (infinite target size)
  - Thumb zones: Primary (natural), Secondary (stretch), Tertiary (shift grip)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS for target sizing and edge positioning
  - JavaScript for radial menu generation and gesture tracking
  - Pointer event handling for multi-input (mouse, touch, stylus)
  - `touch-action` CSS for gesture control
  - Screen edge detection API where available
  - Haptic feedback integration for mobile

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA): 44x44px minimum
  - Support for switch control and dwelling
  - Allow target size increase user preference
  - Provide linear alternatives to radial menus for screen readers
  - Motor impairment: increase target size, add sticky targets

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS for layout and target sizing
  - JavaScript for radial menus and gesture recognition
  - Web Animations API for smooth transitions
  - Pointer Lock API for relative movement interfaces
  - Gamepad API for controller-based navigation

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If ≥4 equidistant options needed → Radial/pie menu
  - If action is frequent → Place at edge or corner
  - If mobile → Optimize for thumb zone (bottom 2/3 of screen)
  - If destructive action → Require deliberate movement (not edge)
  - If precision needed → Allow cursor/finger to rest, target comes to user
  - If selection from range → Arc slider over linear slider

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Movement efficiency (Fitts' Law: Time = a + b × log₂(D/W + 1))
  2. Error prevention (target size sufficient for motor noise)
  3. Discoverability (motor optimization shouldn't hide features)
  4. Aesthetics (design around motor constraints, not despite them)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Large touch targets, logical grouping
  - Basic: Edge-positioned primary actions, optimized spacing
  - Full: Radial menus, gesture shortcuts, predictive target expansion

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Radial menus fall back to dropdown/context menus
  - Gesture navigation falls back to button taps
  - Edge targets maintained even without edge detection API
  - Corner actions work without OS hot-corner conflict detection

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Targets too small; frequent misclicks; radial menus confusing
* 3: Motor-optimized but some secondary actions hard to reach
* 5: Every action reachable with minimal movement; near-zero error rate; feels effortless

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Assumes full motor control; radial menus inaccessible; no alternatives
* 3: Meets WCAG target size; basic alternatives exist
* 5: Full motor accessibility; customizable target sizes; switch/dwell support; linear alternatives

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Heavy gesture library; complex radial menu calculations; performance issues
* 3: Reasonable implementation; some optimization possible
* 5: Lightweight gesture detection; efficient radial rendering; smooth 60fps interactions

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Motor optimization breaks at different screen sizes; thumb zones ignored on tablets
* 3: Adapts to common devices; some edge cases need attention
* 5: Recalculates optimal zones per device; radial menus scale; edge targets always functional

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Motor optimization creates ugly asymmetric layouts; radial feels alien
* 3: Functional but aesthetics clearly secondary to motor concerns
* 5: Motor optimization enhances visual design; radial menus feel natural; asymmetry feels intentional

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All primary actions reachable within single thumb arc (mobile) or 200px mouse movement (desktop)
  - Touch targets ≥ 48px on mobile, ≥ 44px on desktop
  - Radial menu items have ≥ 45° arc each
  - Screen corners used for ≥ 1 frequent action
  - Error rate < 5% for primary actions under time pressure

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Measure time-to-target for primary actions (should improve vs. traditional layout)
  - Test with both hands (optimize for dominant hand, functional for non-dominant)
  - Evaluate radial menu learnability (should be faster after 3 uses)
  - Test with motor impairment simulation (tremor, limited range)

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Error rate exceeds 5% for any primary action
  - Users report fatigue or strain
  - Radial menus slower than linear alternatives after learning period
  - Edge targets conflict with OS-level gestures
  - Left-handed users report significantly worse experience

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Thumb zone maps per device category
  - Radial menu specifications (radius, segments, activation gesture)
  - Edge/corner action assignments
  - Fitts' Law calculations for layout decisions
  - Gesture dictionary with motor cost analysis
  - Handedness adaptation rules
  - Target size scale for accessibility preferences

# [DREAMS MADE VISIBLE, LOGIC DEFIED]

# Surrealist Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces that channel the subconscious—impossible juxtapositions, dreamlike transformations, uncanny familiar-yet-wrong elements, and visual logic that follows dream rules rather than waking reality
* **Constraint Parameters**: Objects must appear in wrong contexts/scales; physics optional; familiar UI elements behave unexpectedly; melting, floating, morphing encouraged; maintain enough reality anchor for usability; the uncanny over the random
* **Reference Context**: Salvador Dalí (melting clocks, elephants on stilts), René Magritte (Treachery of Images, impossible rooms), Max Ernst (frottage, collage), de Chirico (empty plazas, long shadows), contemporary: Studio Feixen, Jonathan Zawada
* **Edge Case Handling**: For usability, ground core interactions in reality while environment is surreal; for accessibility, ensure transformed elements maintain semantic meaning; for motion, dreamlike pace (slow, floating, inevitable)
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Uncanny recognition, dream logic consistency, reality anchor maintenance, emotional unease/wonder balance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Color: Unnatural but specific—flesh tones on sky, metallic organic, impossible lighting
  - Shadows: Wrong direction, multiple sources, shadows without objects
  - Scale: Objects at wrong sizes relative to each other
  - Texture: Hyper-real rendering of impossible things
  - Typography: Can transform, melt, cast impossible shadows; but remains readable
  - Space: Deep perspective, empty horizons, infinite planes

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG morphing for transformations
  - CSS `clip-path` for impossible shapes and reveals
  - 3D CSS transforms for spatial impossibilities
  - Canvas/WebGL for complex surreal environments
  - Slow, eased animations (2-5 second durations; dream pace)
  - Parallax that defies expected depth relationships

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; surreal visuals don't excuse contrast failures
  - Interactive elements must be identifiable despite surreal context
  - Screen readers receive straightforward semantic content
  - Motion is slow enough to not trigger vestibular issues
  - Provide "reality mode" for users who need it

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS transforms and clip-path for 2D surrealism
  - Three.js for 3D impossible spaces
  - GSAP for complex morphing animations
  - Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered transformations
  - Keep surreal layer separate from content layer

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If object familiar → Place in wrong context or scale
  - If space exists → Give it impossible depth or conflicting perspectives
  - If shadow present → Cast it wrong (multiple, missing, independent)
  - If interaction expected → Fulfill it unexpectedly (button works, but melts after)
  - If user scrolls → Environment transforms dreamlike, not snaps
  - If loading state → Perfect opportunity for surreal transformation

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Uncanny recognition (familiar enough to unsettle, not random)
  2. Dream logic consistency (internal rules, just not reality's rules)
  3. Usability anchor (core functions grounded)
  4. Wonder over confusion (surrealism should delight, not frustrate)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Slightly "off" imagery and unexpected juxtapositions (static)
  - Basic: Impossible shadows, wrong-scale elements, spatial oddities
  - Full: Morphing elements, impossible physics, dreamlike transitions

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - 3D spaces fall back to 2D surreal compositions
  - Animations fall back to static surreal imagery
  - Complex morphs fall back to fade transitions
  - Print: Magritte/Dalí-style static compositions

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Surrealism destroys usability; users can't find anything
* 3: Core functions work but surreal elements occasionally confuse
* 5: Surreal environment enhances engagement; core actions grounded and clear

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Surrealism used to excuse poor accessibility
* 3: Meets minimums; surreal elements have appropriate alternatives
* 5: Full compliance; AT users get content; surrealism is visual layer only

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Complex 3D surrealism tanks performance
* 3: Runs smoothly on modern devices; some optimization needed
* 5: Efficient surrealism; impossible effects from simple techniques; smooth everywhere

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Surreal compositions break at different viewports
* 3: Adapts but loses some impossible relationships at sizes
* 5: Each viewport has its own surreal composition; dream logic maintained

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Random weirdness without surrealist logic
* 3: Recognizably surreal but some elements feel arbitrary
* 5: Consistent dream logic; every impossibility serves the whole; genuine uncanny feeling

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - At least one scale impossibility per major section
  - Shadows present that defy single light source
  - Familiar objects appear in minimum 1 wrong context
  - Core navigation findable within 5 seconds despite surreal environment
  - Animation durations average 2+ seconds (dream pace)

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users recognize surrealist intent (not "broken")
  - Test emotional response: should evoke wonder/unease, not frustration
  - Evaluate usability beneath surreal layer
  - Measure engagement: users should explore, not flee

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users describe as "weird" without "interesting"
  - Surrealism creates actual confusion about navigation
  - Impossible elements feel random rather than dreamlike
  - Motion causes discomfort
  - Effect described as "trying too hard"

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Surrealist technique inventory (which impossibilities are used)
  - Dream logic rules (what internal consistency exists)
  - Reality anchor points (where usability is grounded)
  - Animation timing guidelines (dream pace specifications)
  - Artist reference mood board
  - Impossibility hierarchy (what breaks first, what stays real longest)

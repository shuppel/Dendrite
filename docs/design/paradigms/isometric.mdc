# [3D PERSPECTIVE, NO VANISHING POINTS]

# Isometric Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements and illustrations using true isometric projection (30° angles) to convey depth and dimensionality without perspective distortion
* **Constraint Parameters**: Strict 2:1 pixel ratio for isometric lines; no vanishing points; consistent 120° angles between axes; maintain visual hierarchy despite uniform scale
* **Reference Context**: Monument Valley (ustwo games), Civilization VI fog-of-war UI, Stripe's isometric illustrations, Airbnb's Lottie animations
* **Edge Case Handling**: For complex scenes, use layered z-index with consistent stacking; for animations, interpolate along isometric axes only; for responsive, scale uniformly (never stretch)
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Angular accuracy, depth clarity, visual balance, interaction affordance in 3D space

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary angles: 30° / 150° / 90° (true isometric)
  - Grid unit: 8px base with 4px half-steps for detail work
  - Stroke weights: 1px edges, 2px for emphasis/selection states
  - Color strategy: Top face lightest, left face mid-tone, right face darkest (or inverse for light source right)
  - Typography: Flat 2D overlays preferred; if embedded, horizontal only (never rotated to match planes)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - SVG preferred for scalability and precise angles
  - CSS transforms: `rotateX(60deg) rotateZ(45deg)` for DOM-based isometric
  - Canvas/WebGL for complex interactive scenes
  - Maintain 1:1 aspect ratio containers to prevent distortion

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance for all text (keep text 2D/flat)
  - Minimum 3:1 contrast between adjacent isometric faces
  - Interactive elements require clear hover/focus states with consistent depth cues
  - Alt text must describe spatial relationships, not just objects

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Pure CSS for simple UI elements (cards, buttons)
  - SVG for illustrations and icons
  - Three.js/PixiJS only when animation complexity requires it
  - No perspective transforms (breaks isometric contract)

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is interactive → Add elevation change on hover (+4px z-axis shift)
  - If scene has > 5 objects → Implement consistent shadow/occlusion system
  - If content is data-driven → Use flat 2D overlay panels anchored to isometric base
  - If animation required → Constrain motion to isometric axes (no free rotation)
  - If mobile viewport → Reduce scene complexity, prioritize foreground elements

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Angular consistency (30° must be exact across all elements)
  2. Depth readability (user must understand spatial relationships)
  3. Interactive clarity (clickable areas obvious despite 3D illusion)
  4. Visual interest and brand differentiation

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Flat 2D representation with isometric-inspired shapes
  - Basic: Static SVG isometric illustration
  - Full: Interactive isometric scene with hover states and animations

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Serve flat 2D alternative when transforms unsupported
  - Reduce to static image for print/email contexts
  - Simplify to outline/wireframe isometric for low-bandwidth scenarios

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Isometric perspective creates confusion about interactive areas or hierarchy
* 3: Functional but spatial relationships occasionally unclear; interaction areas require labels
* 5: Isometric view enhances understanding; depth communicates hierarchy; interactions feel natural in 3D space

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Text embedded in isometric planes; insufficient face contrast; no spatial alt text
* 3: Text mostly flat; adequate contrast; basic accessibility compliance
* 5: All text 2D; excellent face differentiation; rich alt text describing spatial layout; keyboard navigation follows logical depth order

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Heavy 3D library for simple static illustration; broken angles; performance issues
* 3: Appropriate tech choice but some redundancy; minor angle inconsistencies
* 5: Optimal implementation (CSS/SVG for simple, canvas for complex); pixel-perfect angles; smooth 60fps interactions

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Distortion at different sizes; broken proportions on resize
* 3: Scales correctly but loses detail or becomes cluttered at extremes
* 5: Uniform scaling preserves all relationships; responsive breakpoints adjust complexity appropriately

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Inconsistent angles, mixed light sources, arbitrary depth ordering
* 3: Mostly consistent but occasional violations; light source wavers
* 5: Perfect angular consistency; unified light source across scene; logical depth stacking; harmonious color gradation across faces

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All isometric lines measure exactly 30° or 150° from horizontal (±0.5° tolerance)
  - Face brightness follows consistent light source (variance < 10% across same-facing planes)
  - Interactive elements show visible state change within 100ms of input
  - No perspective distortion present (parallel lines remain parallel)

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users can identify clickable regions without instruction
  - Test depth perception: users should correctly order overlapping elements
  - Evaluate cognitive load: isometric view should not slow task completion vs 2D baseline

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - > 15% of users misclick due to unclear interactive boundaries
  - Angular measurements deviate > 1° from true isometric
  - Scene complexity causes render time > 16ms (60fps threshold)
  - User testing shows confusion about foreground/background relationships

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Isometric grid template (SVG/Figma/Sketch asset)
  - Face color calculation formula based on base color + light direction
  - Transform matrix reference for CSS/SVG implementations
  - Z-index stacking convention diagram
  - Code examples for common patterns (isometric card, button, scene container)

# [GESTURE AS MEANING, CHAOS AS EXPRESSION]

# Abstract Expressionist Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces channeling Abstract Expressionism—spontaneous gesture, emotional intensity, action and process as content, rejection of representation, all-over composition, and raw material expression
* **Constraint Parameters**: Gesture must feel spontaneous (not calculated); marks express process of creation; no representational imagery; all-over composition (no single focal point); color as emotion not description; embrace accident and chance; scale matters (should feel immersive)
* **Reference Context**: Jackson Pollock (drip paintings, all-over composition), Willem de Kooning (gestural brushwork), Franz Kline (bold black gestures), Mark Rothko (color field—different branch), Helen Frankenthaler (stain painting), Robert Motherwell (Elegies)
* **Edge Case Handling**: For usability, content floats above gestural field; for accessibility, ensure gesture layer doesn't obscure function; for performance, balance complexity with load time; for responsiveness, gestures regenerate per viewport
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Gestural authenticity, emotional intensity, spontaneity perception, immersive scale, process visibility

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Palette: Limited but intense—black, white, one or two emotional colors
  - Action colors: Urgent red (#C41E3A), Raw umber (#714B23), Cadmium yellow (#FFF600), Prussian blue (#003153)
  - Mark-making: Drips, splatters, broad strokes, accumulated gestures
  - Background: Raw canvas (#F5F0E1) or pure white/black field
  - No gradients except natural paint blending
  - Typography: Either stark utilitarian (the content) or hand-painted (becoming gesture)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Canvas API for dynamic gesture generation
  - SVG for scalable gestural marks
  - Procedural generation with controlled randomness
  - Large viewport utilization (gestures need scale)
  - requestAnimationFrame for live gestural animation
  - Touch/mouse input can generate user gestures

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA for content layer above gestural field
  - Gesture layer is purely decorative (marked aria-hidden)
  - Content survives without gesture (progressive enhancement)
  - Motion preferences respected (static gesture snapshot)
  - Screen readers receive clean content; ignore chaos

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Canvas for complex procedural gestures
  - SVG for simple gestural elements
  - CSS for basic splatter/drip effects where possible
  - WebGL for immersive gestural environments
  - Pre-rendered gesture options for performance

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If mark needed → Generate with randomness; never place precisely
  - If color choice → Emotional, not decorative; limited palette
  - If composition → All-over; no single focal point hierarchy
  - If user interacts → Can contribute gesture to field
  - If loading → Process of generation can be visible (action painting)
  - If content exists → Float above gestural field; distinct layer

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Gestural authenticity (marks must feel made, not placed)
  2. Emotional intensity (design should provoke feeling)
  3. Process visibility (creation as content)
  4. Content legibility (function floats above expression)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Content on neutral background (utilitarian)
  - Basic: Static gestural background (pre-rendered)
  - Full: Dynamic gesture generation, user participation, immersive scale

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Canvas falls back to static gesture image
  - Dynamic falls back to pre-rendered set of gesture variations
  - All-over composition falls back to simpler gestural accents
  - Print: Single gesture capture (each print unique, like prints)

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Gesture overwhelms content; nothing findable
* 3: Content accessible but gestural intensity distracts
* 5: Gesture creates emotional environment; content clearly floats above; enhances rather than impedes

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Gesture layer interferes with function; chaotic for AT
* 3: Content accessible; gesture layer properly separated
* 5: Full compliance; gesture purely decorative and labeled; content experience clean

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Complex gesture generation kills performance
* 3: Runs well on modern devices; some optimization needed
* 5: Efficient procedural generation; pre-render options; smooth across devices

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Gestures don't scale; fixed composition breaks
* 3: Adapts but loses immersive quality at some sizes
* 5: Gestures regenerate per viewport; scale maintained; intensity adapts

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Random marks without gestural logic; feels like filter
* 3: Recognizable AbEx aesthetic but some marks feel calculated
* 5: Authentic gestural language; spontaneity achieved; emotionally intense; process visible

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - No two page loads produce identical gesture field (procedural)
  - Gesture marks show variation (no copy-pasted identical elements)
  - Content layer achieves WCAG AA independent of gesture layer
  - Palette limited to maximum 5 colors in gesture field
  - Marks extend to/beyond viewport edges (all-over composition)

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify emotional response: should feel "intense," "energetic," "raw"
  - Test gesture recognition: users should perceive as artistic, not error
  - Evaluate content findability despite gestural intensity
  - Measure engagement: gestural environment should invite exploration

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Gestures feel calculated or placed rather than spontaneous
  - Emotional intensity reads as mere visual noise
  - Users describe as "messy" rather than "expressive"
  - Content obscured by gestural layer
  - Performance issues from gesture generation

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Gesture generation algorithms with randomness parameters
  - Palette with emotional associations
  - Layer separation specification (content above gesture)
  - Procedural seed management (reproducibility if needed)
  - Artist reference mood board
  - Process documentation (how gestures are made, not just what they look like)

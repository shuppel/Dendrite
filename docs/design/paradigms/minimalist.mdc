# [LESS IS MORE, ESSENTIAL ONLY]

# Minimalist Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements reduced to absolute essentials—maximum negative space, limited color palette, typography-driven hierarchy, and elimination of everything that doesn't serve a clear purpose
* **Constraint Parameters**: Maximum 2-3 colors; no decorative elements; whitespace as primary design tool; every element must justify its existence; "when in doubt, leave it out"
* **Reference Context**: Dieter Rams' 10 principles, Apple.com, Muji, Aesop, Kinfolk, The New York Times digital edition, Medium reading experience
* **Edge Case Handling**: For content-rich contexts, minimalism applies to chrome not content; for dark mode, maintain restraint with warm darks; for accessibility, simplicity should aid not hinder
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Essential element count, whitespace ratio, visual noise level, cognitive load reduction

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Primary palette: Near-black (#111111 or #1A1A1A), Near-white (#FAFAFA or #F8F8F8), one accent (optional, muted)
  - Accent if used: Single hue, desaturated (not vibrant)
  - No gradients, no patterns, no textures
  - Typography: One typeface family (two max—serif + sans pairing); hierarchy via size/weight only
  - Spacing: Generous, consistent, mathematical (8px scale recommended)

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - Zero decorative CSS (no shadows unless functional, no borders unless necessary)
  - Maximum 100KB CSS (minimalism in code too)
  - System font stack acceptable (ultimate minimalism)
  - Line heights: 1.5-1.7 for optimal readability
  - Maximum content width: 65-75 characters for body text

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AAA target (minimalism enables this)
  - High contrast inherent in limited palette
  - Clear focus states (simple outline sufficient)
  - Typography optimized for readability
  - Minimal cognitive load benefits all users

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Pure CSS; no frameworks if possible
  - No icon libraries (use text labels or essential custom icons)
  - No images unless they ARE the content
  - No animation unless it provides meaning

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is decorative → Remove it
  - If information can be implied → Don't state it explicitly
  - If two elements serve similar purpose → Combine or eliminate one
  - If color is needed → Can it be achieved with black/white/gray first?
  - If interaction needs feedback → Minimal state change (opacity, underline)

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Content clarity (nothing between user and information)
  2. Essential function (every element earns its place)
  3. Visual breathing room (whitespace is not empty)
  4. Typographic excellence (type does the heavy lifting)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Semantic HTML with browser defaults (already minimal)
  - Basic: Typography refinement, spacing optimization
  - Full: Subtle micro-interactions, perfect vertical rhythm

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Minimalism IS the fallback for other paradigms
  - For print: Natural translation; minimalism prints beautifully
  - For email: Ideal; plain text with minimal styling
  - For constrained environments: Already optimized

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Too minimal; users cannot find or understand functionality
* 3: Functional but some helpful affordances removed unnecessarily
* 5: Perfect balance; everything needed, nothing extra; function obvious

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Minimalism sacrificed contrast or touch target size
* 3: Meets WCAG AA; approaching AAA
* 5: WCAG AAA achieved; minimalism enhances accessibility; optimal for screen readers

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Unnecessary code despite minimal visuals
* 3: Clean but some redundancy
* 5: Code is as minimal as design; fastest load times; tiny footprint

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Spacing breaks at extremes; type doesn't scale well
* 3: Scales but requires some adjustment
* 5: Mathematical spacing system scales infinitely; typography responsive; works at any size

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Inconsistent spacing; some decorative elements crept in
* 3: Mostly minimal but occasional violations
* 5: Absolute purity; every element essential; whitespace perfectly balanced; zen-like calm

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Maximum 3 colors in palette (including black/white)
  - Zero decorative images (images must be content)
  - Whitespace ratio ≥ 50% on any screen
  - Single typeface (or justified serif/sans pair)
  - Every visible element has documented purpose

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users can complete tasks without confusion
  - Test perception: should feel "calm," "clean," "focused"
  - Measure time to locate information (should be fast)
  - Evaluate emotional response: clarity not sterility

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Users cannot find needed functionality
  - Stakeholders add elements without purpose justification
  - Any decorative element introduced (challenge it)
  - Users describe as "empty" or "unfinished" (communicate value of space)
  - Users describe as "cold" (may need warmth in color temperature)

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Element inventory with purpose justification for each
  - Typography scale (sizes, weights, use cases)
  - Spacing scale with mathematical basis
  - Color palette (maximum 3 values)
  - Removal log (elements considered and rejected, with reasoning)
  - "Less is more" guidelines for future additions

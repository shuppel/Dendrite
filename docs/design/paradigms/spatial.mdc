# [DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATION, INFINITE CANVAS]

# Spatial/Nested Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces where navigation occurs through 3D space—zooming into nested content, panning across infinite canvases, and moving through dimensional layers rather than page-to-page transitions
* **Constraint Parameters**: Depth must communicate hierarchy; zoom levels have clear stopping points; spatial relationships remain consistent; users must always understand their location; performance critical for smooth navigation
* **Reference Context**: Prezi presentations, Figma's infinite canvas, macOS Mission Control, iOS app folders, Google Maps zoom, Miro/FigJam boards, Notion toggle hierarchies, old Starfield screensaver navigation
* **Edge Case Handling**: For accessibility, provide linear navigation alternative; for mobile, simplify to 2D panning with depth indicators; for performance, level-of-detail (LOD) rendering at distance
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Spatial comprehension, navigation fluidity, depth clarity, orientation maintenance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Depth cues: Scale reduction (80% per level), blur increase, opacity fade
  - Z-space colors: Foreground vibrant; background desaturated toward gray/blue
  - Active level: Full saturation, sharp edges, 100% opacity
  - Inactive levels: 60-80% opacity, slight blur, reduced saturation
  - Typography: Size scales with zoom; minimum readable threshold enforced
  - Connectors: Lines or proximity indicating parent-child relationships

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS transforms for zoom (`scale()`) and pan (`translate()`)
  - `will-change: transform` for smooth animation
  - Level-of-detail rendering (hide detail at distance)
  - Smooth easing (300-500ms transitions; ease-out for natural deceleration)
  - Canvas/WebGL for complex infinite spaces
  - Minimap for orientation in large spaces

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA compliance at every zoom level
  - Keyboard navigation through spatial hierarchy (Tab = next item, Enter = zoom in, Escape = zoom out)
  - Screen reader announces current depth level and available directions
  - Reduced motion: instant transitions, breadcrumb navigation fallback
  - Focus visible at all zoom levels

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - CSS transforms for simple nested zoom
  - Canvas for large/infinite spaces with many objects
  - WebGL for 3D spatial navigation
  - Virtualization for performance with many nested items
  - Gesture support (pinch-zoom, two-finger pan)

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If content is hierarchical → Enable zoom-to-child navigation
  - If content is relational (non-hierarchical) → Enable pan across infinite canvas
  - If > 3 levels deep → Provide minimap or breadcrumb
  - If target item → Zoom smoothly to fill viewport
  - If user is lost → Provide "home" zoom-out-to-root action

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Orientation (user always knows where they are)
  2. Navigation fluidity (transitions feel natural, not jarring)
  3. Depth comprehension (hierarchy visible through spatial cues)
  4. Performance (60fps during navigation)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Linear navigation with visual hierarchy indicators
  - Basic: Simple zoom transitions between levels
  - Full: Smooth infinite canvas with gesture support, minimap, spatial audio cues

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Complex 3D space falls back to 2D nested zoom
  - Infinite canvas falls back to paginated grid
  - Gesture navigation falls back to click-to-zoom
  - For print: Flatten to hierarchical outline with indentation

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Users constantly lost; can't find way back; unclear what's clickable
* 3: Navigation works but some depth transitions confusing
* 5: Intuitive spatial movement; users explore naturally; never lost

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: No keyboard navigation; screen readers can't parse space; motion causes issues
* 3: Basic keyboard support; breadcrumb available; reduced motion honored
* 5: Full keyboard spatial navigation; screen reader announces depth/direction; multiple navigation modes

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Janky zoom; massive memory usage; freezes on deep nesting
* 3: Smooth on modern devices; some optimization needed for complex spaces
* 5: 60fps always; virtualized rendering; efficient LOD; works on mid-tier mobile

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Breaks with > 10 items or > 2 levels
* 3: Handles moderate complexity; performance degrades gracefully
* 5: Infinite canvas truly infinite; deep nesting performant; scales to any content size

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Depth cues inconsistent; some items don't scale; transitions jarring
* 3: Mostly consistent but occasional visual glitches during navigation
* 5: Seamless depth perception; smooth transitions; consistent visual language at all zoom levels

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - User can return to root from any depth in ≤ 3 actions
  - Zoom transitions complete in 300-500ms with easing
  - Current depth level always visible (breadcrumb or minimap)
  - Frame rate never drops below 30fps during navigation
  - Keyboard can access any item accessible by mouse

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify users can find specific nested item without instruction
  - Test orientation: pause mid-navigation and ask "where are you?"
  - Evaluate motion comfort: no reports of nausea or disorientation
  - Measure time-to-target vs. traditional navigation

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - > 20% of users use "home" button to escape confusion
  - Users describe as "disorienting" or "nauseating"
  - Performance drops below 45fps on target devices
  - Users can't describe the spatial structure after use
  - Keyboard users can't navigate effectively

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Zoom level specifications (scale, blur, opacity per level)
  - Transition timing and easing curves
  - Minimap design and update frequency
  - Gesture mapping (pinch, pan, double-tap)
  - Keyboard navigation map
  - Accessibility announcement scripts for screen readers
  - Performance budgets per zoom level

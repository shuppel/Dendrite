# [UNIVERSAL TRUTH, PURE FORM]

# Modernist Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create interfaces embodying early 20th century Modernist ideals—universal forms, rejection of ornament, truth to materials, functionalism, geometric abstraction, and belief in design as rational problem-solving
* **Constraint Parameters**: Ornament is crime (Loos); form follows function (Sullivan); less is more (Mies); universal over particular; geometric purity; asymmetric balance; honest materiality; visible structure; reject historicism and decoration
* **Reference Context**: Le Corbusier (Modulor, Villa Savoie), Mies van der Rohe (Barcelona Pavilion), Bauhaus (Gropius, Breuer), De Stijl (Mondrian, Rietveld), Constructivism, International Style, Herbert Matter, Max Bill
* **Edge Case Handling**: For warmth, use material honesty not decoration; for brand expression, geometry and proportion not ornament; for accessibility, functionalism naturally supports clarity
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Formal purity, ornament absence, functional justification, geometric rigor, material honesty

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Color: Limited palette derived from materials and primaries; no decorative gradients
  - Primaries: Red (#E53935), Yellow (#FDD835), Blue (#1E88E5) used sparingly
  - Neutrals: White (#FFFFFF), Black (#000000), Concrete gray (#A0A0A0), Glass transparency
  - Typography: Geometric sans-serif (Futura, Avant Garde, Helvetica, Univers); no serifs, no scripts
  - Proportions: Golden ratio, Modulor, mathematical relationships
  - Grid: Strict, visible as organizing principle, never decorative

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - CSS Grid for rigorous layout structure
  - Precise mathematical spacing (Fibonacci, golden ratio)
  - No decorative CSS (no unnecessary shadows, gradients, borders)
  - Typography as information, not expression
  - Minimal DOM; structure visible in code
  - Performance as functional virtue

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AAA naturally achieved through clarity and contrast
  - Functionalism serves accessibility
  - Clear visual hierarchy from geometric organization
  - No decoration to confuse; every element has purpose
  - Screen reader experience as clean as visual

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Pure CSS for everything possible
  - No JavaScript for decoration; only for function
  - Code should be as clean as design
  - Comments explain function, not apologize
  - Reject frameworks that add unnecessary complexity

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is decorative only → Remove it
  - If complexity exists → Justify by function or simplify
  - If choice between ornament and clarity → Always clarity
  - If style vs. function conflict → Function wins
  - If multiple solutions exist → Choose simplest that works
  - If material effect possible → Prefer honest digital material (light, pixel, interaction)

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Function (every element serves purpose)
  2. Clarity (communication without noise)
  3. Formal purity (geometric, mathematical, universal)
  4. Material honesty (digital materials, not skeuomorphic)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Semantic HTML (pure structure is Modernist)
  - Basic: Typographic hierarchy, strict grid, minimal color
  - Full: Mathematical proportions, perfect rhythm, material behavior

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Modernism degrades beautifully (less is more)
  - Without CSS: HTML structure still functions
  - Print: Natural translation; Modernism prints perfectly
  - Extreme constraints reveal essence (Modernist virtue)

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Formal purity sacrificed function; too austere to use
* 3: Functional but some geometric rigidity impedes
* 5: Form and function unified; clarity enhances usability; nothing unnecessary

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Modernist purity ignored accessibility needs
* 3: Meets standards through simplicity
* 5: Functionalism naturally creates excellent accessibility; WCAG AAA

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Bloated code despite minimal appearance
* 3: Clean but some redundancy
* 5: Code as minimal as design; tiny footprint; fast loading; pure

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Mathematical proportions break at extremes
* 3: Scales with some ratio adjustments
* 5: Universal proportions scale infinitely; grids adapt; purity maintained

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Ornament crept in; inconsistent geometry; decoration disguised
* 3: Mostly pure but occasional decorative elements
* 5: Absolute purity; every element functionally justified; could be 1925 or 2025

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - Zero decorative elements (every element has documented function)
  - Spacing values follow mathematical relationship (not arbitrary)
  - No more than 3-5 colors (derived from primaries or materials)
  - Grid structure visible in layout (no elements break grid without function)
  - Typography limited to single family (two maximum for hierarchy)

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify clarity: users find content faster than decorated alternatives
  - Test perception: should register as "clear," "confident," "timeless"
  - Evaluate coldness: should feel "calm" not "hostile"
  - Measure function: task completion should be frictionless

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Any decorative element discovered
  - Users describe as "cold" or "inhuman"
  - Stakeholders request ornament (educate on Modernist principles)
  - Mathematical proportions feel awkward (re-examine ratios)
  - Simplicity tips into unusability

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Functional justification for every element
  - Mathematical basis for proportions and spacing
  - Material vocabulary (what are our "honest digital materials")
  - Grid specification with no decorative exceptions
  - Typography as information system
  - Modernist manifesto for team education

# [PHYSICAL SURFACES, MEANINGFUL MOTION]

# Material Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create UI elements based on physical material metaphor—surfaces exist in 3D space with consistent lighting, elevation creates hierarchy, and motion provides meaning and continuity
* **Constraint Parameters**: Elevation via shadow (not gradients); surfaces are opaque (not glass); motion has purpose and physics; color system follows 500-series primary with semantic assignments; 8dp grid
* **Reference Context**: Google Material Design 3, Android system UI, Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube, Material Components library
* **Edge Case Handling**: For iOS contexts, soften slightly but maintain elevation logic; for dark mode, use overlay elevation (surface tinting) not just inverted shadows; for dense UIs, reduce elevation levels
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Elevation consistency, motion purpose, color system adherence, touch target compliance

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: 
  - Elevation levels: 0dp (flat), 1dp, 2dp, 4dp, 8dp, 12dp, 16dp, 24dp
  - Shadow formula: Umbra + Penumbra + Ambient (three-layer system)
  - Primary color: 500 value as base; 100-900 scale for variants
  - Surface colors: White (#FFFFFF) light mode; #121212 dark mode with overlay tinting
  - Typography: Roboto or system font; specific scale (headline, title, body, caption, overline)
  - Corner radius: 4dp default; pills for FABs and chips

* **Technical Requirements**: 
  - 8dp grid for all spacing and sizing
  - Touch targets: 48dp minimum (44dp with sufficient spacing)
  - Shadow implementation: `box-shadow` with three layers matching elevation
  - Transitions: 200-300ms standard; use emphasized easing for enter/exit
  - Ripple effect for touch feedback

* **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - WCAG AA minimum; Material's color system designed for contrast
  - Touch targets meet 48dp requirement
  - Focus indicators via elevation change + outline
  - Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - State layers (hover, focus, pressed) via overlay opacity

* **Implementation Boundaries**: 
  - Material Components libraries preferred (MUI, Vuetify, Angular Material)
  - CSS custom properties for elevation shadows
  - JavaScript for ripple effects and complex transitions
  - SVG for Material Icons (24dp grid)

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  - If element is raised → Assign elevation level based on hierarchy
  - If element is interactive → Add ripple feedback + elevation change on press
  - If navigation → Use component patterns (drawer, tabs, bottom nav per context)
  - If action → Primary = FAB or contained button; Secondary = outlined/text button
  - If modal/overlay → Highest elevation (16-24dp); scrim behind

* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Elevation logic (higher = more prominent; shadows must be consistent)
  2. Touch feedback (every interactive element responds)
  3. Motion purpose (animation explains spatial relationships)
  4. Color semantics (primary, secondary, error, surface used correctly)

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Core: Elevation via shadow, proper touch targets
  - Basic: Color system, typography scale, basic transitions
  - Full: Ripple effects, motion choreography, adaptive density

* **Fallback Strategy**:
  - Ripple falls back to opacity change on press
  - Complex motion falls back to simple fade
  - Dark mode elevation falls back to visible borders
  - Three-layer shadow falls back to single shadow

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Functionality (1-5)
* 1: Elevation hierarchy confusing; interactive elements unclear
* 3: Functional but some elevation inconsistencies; motion occasionally jarring
* 5: Elevation perfectly communicates hierarchy; motion guides attention; interactions feel physical

### Accessibility (1-5)
* 1: Touch targets too small; insufficient contrast; no reduced-motion support
* 3: Meets minimums but some edge cases need attention
* 5: Full compliance; generous touch targets; excellent contrast; motion respects preferences

### Implementation Efficiency (1-5)
* 1: Custom shadow implementations per element; bloated transitions
* 3: Uses Material library but with unnecessary overrides
* 5: Leverages component library efficiently; design tokens for all values; optimized bundle

### Scalability (1-5)
* 1: Elevation levels inconsistent across app; color system broken
* 3: Scales but requires manual maintenance of token alignment
* 5: Design tokens seamlessly scale; theming system allows brand customization; consistent at all densities

### Visual Coherence (1-5)
* 1: Mixed elevation logic; shadows point different directions; color usage arbitrary
* 3: Mostly coherent but occasional Material guideline violations
* 5: Pure Material execution; unified elevation; consistent motion language; color system perfectly applied

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  - All spacing values divisible by 8dp (4dp for dense contexts)
  - Touch targets ≥ 48dp (or ≥ 44dp with 8dp+ surrounding space)
  - Elevation shadows match Material specification for assigned dp level
  - Primary actions use primary color; destructive use error color
  - Transitions between 150-400ms with appropriate easing

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  - Verify touch accuracy on mobile devices
  - Test elevation hierarchy comprehension (which elements feel "above" others)
  - Evaluate motion perception: should feel "natural," "smooth," "guiding"

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  - Touch targets fail 48dp audit
  - Elevation does not match component importance
  - Motion feels disconnected or arbitrary
  - Color usage doesn't follow semantic rules
  - Android/Google users report unfamiliarity (should feel native)

* **Documentation Standards**:
  - Elevation scale with shadow values per level
  - Color system with primary, secondary, tertiary, surface, error definitions
  - Typography scale with use cases
  - Motion specifications (duration, easing per transition type)
  - Component inventory matching Material guidelines
  - Density scale specifications (default, comfortable, compact)
